# Bob the personal assistant 2.0

_"Rutiinit roboteille, analyysit ammattilaisille"_

a.k.a Bob goes the world wide web. An updated & upgraded, fully personalized personal assistant project for keeping track of the trivial parts of everyday life so I can focus on something else. And, meanwhile, apply things I am learning.
